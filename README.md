# MailForZim - Created by Oren, for ZIM
* Java, Maven, API, javamail-api

## Installation
This project need the Email AppPassword to work - the AppPassword should be used in 'MailForZim/src/main/java/env.properties'.

## Project structure
The project created to show how to get specific email by using the java.mail API.
This is why there are there areas in this project that you can remove and edit:
1) lines 30-32: in this area a new email is sent.
2) lines 34-36 in this area a new email that will be found is sent.
3) lines 38-39: in this area all the emails that should be found will be found and printed to the cosole.

## note
Once the emails will be found, only new emails will return from the email server,
This is why I decided to leave these lines of code in the project, to make it easier to use the program.
